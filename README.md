# reAMP

reamp is an offline-first, album-centric music player for sound nerds

### features

- winamp-esque library / playlist / queue separation
- album and directory structure views
- smart shuffle algorithm -- no repeats until playlist exhausted; randomized between artists so artists with many songs do not monopolize the playlist
- studio quality equalizer -- graphic (constant-Q, ISO 32 band) and 4-band DJ  (allen & heath frequency model)
- studio quality audio analysis / visualizations (VU meter, oscilloscope, spectrum analyzer, full track waveform, displays for bitrate, samplerate)
- logarithmic volume control
- remote control -- seek / volume control via mobile; later allow queuing and adding youtube URLs ('party mode')
- displays album art from folder, track, or discogs
- streaming support - youtube, soundcloud, shoutcast
- DJ controls - loop, tempo, multi-track
- gain control with boost (reAMP goes to 11!)
- fuzzer / tube emulator
- compressor
- gapless playback / crossfading
- universal kb shortcuts
- support MP3, AIFF, WAV, MPEG-4, AAC, M4A, OGG, FLAC playback

#### wishlist:
- voice control
- auto DJ (select next track based on genre > bpm > key; align beats; sync tempo; x-fade @ -8 bar)
